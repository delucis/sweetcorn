Sweetcorn supports two main types of dithering algorithms: threshold maps and error diffusion.

This page includes examples of all the built-in dithering algorithms accompanied by a demonstration image dithered by the algorithm:

<Image src={demo} alt="" dither={false} />

## Threshold maps

Threshold maps apply a fixed pattern to the image to determine which pixels should be turned on or off.
These algorithms are faster to compute than error diffusion algorithms.
They can produce noticeable patterns in the output image.

### Available threshold map algorithms

<AlgorithmDemo type="thresholdMap" />

## Error diffusion

Error diffusion algorithms work by spreading the quantization error of a pixel to its neighboring pixels.
This results in a more natural dithering effect, but it is more expensive, computing multiple values for each pixel of an image.

### Available error diffusion algorithms

<AlgorithmDemo type="errorDiffusion" />
