A lot has changed since humanity first dithered an image.
Early digital dithering was a way of working around the technical limitations of screens with limited colours.
First, they had simple on/off pixels toggling from black to white or green.
Later, they could maybe show 16 or even 256 colours!
But that was still far too few for most images and dithering helped a lot.

Today, screens can display millions of colours and high-resolution “retina” pixel densities are increasingly common.
Ironically, these high quality screens actually require us to work _harder_ to make our anachronistic, pixel-poor, dithery dots look as good as they should.

Here are some tips to help.

## Make the most of `image-rendering`

Use the CSS [`image-rendering`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/image-rendering) property to control how browsers scale your dithered images.

### Scaling dithered images up

By default, browsers will try to smooth out images when scaling them up.
For common image content like photos this is usually desirable, but for dithered images it can ruin the effect.

For example, here’s a 100px-wide image being displayed at 300px wide, which makes each individual pixel in the image look a bit smudged or blurred:

<Image src={demo} alt="A large dithered test image where the pixel detail is blurred" dither="bayer-4" width={100} style="image-rendering: auto; width: 300px;" />

Using the `pixelated` (or `crisp-edges`) image rendering algorithm will use nearest-neighbour scaling, preserving the sharp details of your dithered images:

```css
img {
  image-rendering: pixelated;
}
```

Here’s that same image as before.
The only difference is the `image-rendering` property and now each individual pixel looks crisp and clear:
  
<Image src={demo} alt="A large dithered test image where the pixels are sharp" dither="bayer-4" width={100} style="image-rendering: pixelated; width: 300px;" />

This is one of the super powers of dithered images!
A regular image tends to look bad scaled up, but with the right CSS a small image file can have a big impact.

### Scaling dithered images down

While using `image-rendering: pixelated` is great for scaling dithered images up, it can cause undesirable results when scaling images down.

Let’s flip our example from before.
This time we’ll scale a 300px-wide image down to 85px, 100px, and 110px wide using `image-rendering: pixelated`.
The middle image is a exactly 3x smaller than the original and looks OK, but because the other two images divide the original size by a fraction, we can see unpredictable moiré patterns interfering with the image:

<p class="not-content">
<span class="sr-only">Three images showing dithered images scaled down using image-rendering: pixelated. The leftmost and rightmost images feature unwanted moiré patterns.</span>
<Image src={demo} alt="" dither="bayer-4" width={300} style="image-rendering: pixelated; width: 85px; height: auto;" />{' '}
<Image src={demo} alt="" dither="bayer-4" width={300} style="image-rendering: pixelated; width: 100px; height: auto;" />{' '}
<Image src={demo} alt="" dither="bayer-4" width={300} style="image-rendering: pixelated; width: 110px; height: auto;" />
</p>

In this case, we can improve the appearance by using the default CSS scaling algorithm instead:

```css
img {
  image-rendering: auto;
}
```

This produces a more predictable (although not always perfect) result across the different sizes:

<p class="not-content">
<span class="sr-only">Three images showing dithered images scaled down using image-rendering: auto. The moiré patterns are reduced.</span>
<Image src={demo} alt="" dither="bayer-4" width={300} style="image-rendering: auto; width: 85px; height: auto;" />{' '}
<Image src={demo} alt="" dither="bayer-4" width={300} style="image-rendering: auto; width: 100px; height: auto;" />{' '}
<Image src={demo} alt="" dither="bayer-4" width={300} style="image-rendering: auto; width: 110px; height: auto;" />
</p>

## Small file sizes

Beyond the visual aesthetic, one other advantage of dithered images is their relatively small file size.
The actual results will vary by image and dithering algorithm, but here’s one comparison of the same 360px-wide image (scaled down to display side-by-side):

| original | dithered |
|----------|----------|
| <Image src={demo} alt="A test image, showing smooth transitions between shades of grey" dither={false} width={360} style="image-rendering: auto; max-width: 180px;" /> | <Image src={demo} alt="The same image dithered, showing bands of shades of gray" dither="bayer-4" width={360} style="image-rendering: auto; max-width: 180px;" /> |
| 6.58 kB | 1.62 kB | 

In this case, even though the original image is an optimized WebP, the dithered image is still more than 4 times smaller than it.
Combine this with the ability to [scale dithered images up](#scaling-dithered-images-up) with `image-rendering: pixelated` and you can deliver visually interesting images with a very small file size.

Bandwidth-aware and eco-conscious websites have made us of dithered images because of their small size. For example, [LOW←TECH MAGAZINE’s solar-powered website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/#dithered-images) notes:

> By dithering, we can make images ten times less resource-intensive, even though they are displayed much larger than on the old website.

This is important because, according to the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images), the average web page in 2025 downloads around 1 MB of images.
