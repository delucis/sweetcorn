A custom Astro image service to generate retro dithered images.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have an Astro website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Install Astro"](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/) guide in the Astro docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<Steps>

1. `astro-retro-image-service` is an Astro [integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/). Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add astro-retro-image-service" />

2. Apply dithering to your images using the `dither` prop on the `<Image>` component from `astro:assets`.

   ```astro /dither=.+/
   ---
   import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
   import exampleImage from './example.jpg';
   ---

   <Image
      src={exampleImage}
      alt="Example Image"
      dither="bayer-8"
   />
   ```

   See the [“Algorithms”](/algorithms/) page for examples of all algorithms supported in the `dither` prop.

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to see the integration in action.
